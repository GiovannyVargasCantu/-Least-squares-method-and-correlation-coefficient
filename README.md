Made this program in my 2nd semester of my career, for Physics Lab

The documentation is in the file, the thing is its in Spanish language, I want to keep my old code exactly as it used to be, so I wont change the documentation, feel free to use software to translate the documentation, as the Hispanic community does to translate the English documentation.
